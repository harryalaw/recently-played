 * What do I want to do here?
 * I want to get all of the data from the DB, then in the UI I want to get the relevant spotify data
 *
 * The boring way is to just get the tracks in batches
 *  -> I think to rethink this we would need to store artist/album data instead to more easily batch on that
 *
 *  -> Just show a list of track IDs to start with
